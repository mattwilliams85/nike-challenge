## Nike Coding Challenge

#### Assignment

Here is the site I’d like Matt to play with. This is currently a real ‪Nike.com page -> http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/men
 
Here is what I am looking for.
 
1. Make Responsive. Sometimes we only get desktop comps or have to take a desktop / mobile comp and make it into a fully responsive page. The image I am providing is just the desktop, so I want to see how you’d go about transforming this into a mobile site 

2. Use Bootstrap or Foundation. We have an internal CSS framework that we built in house and it has some similarities with Foundation and Bootstrap; particularly around the grid system. Please use rows and columns to demonstrate your knowledge in using a CSS frameworks grid system.

3. Don’t Worry about the Nav / Menu. You don’t need to worry about interactions or the menu systems. There are two navigations in the design. The left bar that is over the main hero and the global nav. I don’t expect you to do anything with those but if you feel like you want to take a stab at it, go for it.

4. Get Creative. If you think something would be really cool and you want to show off some of your skills, feel free to do so. This is your opportunity to show what you could bring to this team.
5. Have Fun. Spend as much time as you feel you need to give a good example of what you can do. I’d also love to hear how long it took you to build what you are handing over. I would also love to get something by Friday 2/3 Morning.
